# ReportAutoComplete

Mod for Hypixel that adds the Username of every player that sent a message in the chat to the autocompletion when using the /report command.

For example if someone sends a scam message and instantly leaves the lobby you can just use the tab-completion to type the username like you would if they are still in the lobby.
